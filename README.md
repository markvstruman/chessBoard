## About The Project

Created to help groups that struggle with the inaccessibiity of modern chess software.

While online sites such as Chess.com reach over one billion games played per month, the accessibility of these online interfaces are limited. As a close family member grew older and struggled with their fine-motor reflexes, having the pinpoint precision necessary to move each piece became more and more difficult, leading to precious time lost in online matches, putting them at a significant disadvantage to their opponent.

This project illustrates a proof-of-concept, building a microprocessor capable of reading chess moves from a physical board and having that information be displayed by an online opponent. By using physical, weighted pieces, groups with disadvantaged motor functions have easier control over their pieces movement and, as such, have the playing field leveled to account for their needs.

Included are the necessary digital circuits and logic implemented in systems verilog to create a microprocessor on an Altera-DE2 board. Extended functionality to read piece locations from reed-switches and buttons, written in Assembly, are also included to relay this information to a VGA display.

Additional testing files have also been included.
